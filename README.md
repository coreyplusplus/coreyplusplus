# Hey, Iâ€™m Corey! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a high school student from Katy, TX, diving into web development and engineering.  
Currently building skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** whilst looking into freelancing small projects.  

Iâ€™m passionate about eventually creating clean, functional websites and learning how to turn all my ideas into real, usable code.  

### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m working on:  
- Building reusable website templates
- Learning front-end developing skills  (HTML/CSS/JS)  
- Exploring real-world freelance projects

### ðŸ”¨ What I'm using:
- Replit/Github (small steps into version control)
- freeCodeCamp & CS50 (sort of... still on week 0)
- Figma & Google Sites just for early mockups of web design ideas
  
### Always open to feedback, advice, or cool project ideas!!!

*Projects coming eventually, just learning the ropes for now. :)*
