# Hey, Iâ€™m Corey! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a high school student from Katy, TX, diving into **cybersecurity** and **Python Programming**.
Right now, Iâ€™m really focused on building strong skills in networking, Linux, and ethical hacking.

Iâ€™m passionate about learing how systems really work, either it be breaking or securing them ethically.  

### ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m working on :  
- Studying **Python** as my first language
- Exploring **network analysis tools** such as Wireshark
- Finishing up **TryHackMe's Presecurity** Path
- Preparing for future certs (CompTIAA+, Net+, Security+)

### ðŸ”§ Tools & Resources :
- Linux (Crostini on Chromebook, making it work!)
- Github for tracking learning and notes (Maybe some projects here and there ðŸ‘€)
- TryHackMe, ProfessorMesser, YouTube for learning
- VS Code and my beautiful terminal setup <3
  
### Always down to learn from others, take advice, or just build cool things.
